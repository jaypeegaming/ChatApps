Requirements:

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
A Java IDE or text editor to view and edit the source code.
Basic understanding of Java socket programming.
File Structure:

ChatServer.java: Contains the implementation of the server component.
ChatClient.java: Contains the implementation of the client component.
How to Run:

Compile the source files using the Java compiler.

bash
Copy code
javac ChatServer.java
javac ChatClient.java
Start the server by running ChatServer.

bash
Copy code
java ChatServer
Start one or more client instances by running ChatClient.

bash
Copy code
java ChatClient
You can run multiple instances of ChatClient to simulate multiple users chatting.

Usage:

After running the server and connecting client instances, users can send messages by typing them into the console and pressing Enter.
Messages sent by one client are broadcasted to all connected clients, allowing for group chat functionality.
The client application continuously listens for incoming messages from the server and displays them in the console.
Troubleshooting:

If you encounter a java.net.BindException: Address already in use: bind error, it means the specified port is already in use by another process. Refer to the Troubleshooting section in this README for solutions.
Additional Notes:

This chat application provides a basic implementation and does not include features like user authentication, message logging, or graphical user interface (GUI).
Feel free to extend the functionality of the application according to your requirements or experiment with different features.
